Important message:

The current localizations (other than English and French) have not been updated and actually contain invalid entries. If you want to participate to the project by updating them (10 minutes required if you are used to it), you can contact me by email or through the smultron website.

I'm currently thinking of changing the name of this project to accentuate the difference between the original project and this fork. I would like to keep smultron in it. If you have an idea, contact me ^^
